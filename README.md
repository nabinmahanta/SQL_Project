# Pizza Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Overview
This SQL project focuses on analyzing sales data from a pizza restaurant chain to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following tables:
- **Orders**: Contains information about each order placed, including order ID, customer ID, order date, and total amount.
- **Customers**: Includes details about the customers, such as customer ID, name, contact information, etc.
- **Pizza Menu**: Lists all the pizzas available on the menu along with their prices and other relevant details.
- **Order Items**: Connects orders to specific pizzas ordered, detailing the quantity and price for each pizza within an order.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Sales Analysis**: Analyzing sales trends over time.
2. **Customer Insights**: Understanding customer behavior and preferences.
3. **Menu Optimization**: Identifying popular and unpopular items to optimize the menu.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Calculating key performance metrics such as average order value, customer retention rate, etc.

## SQL Queries
The project involves writing SQL queries to:
- Retrieve sales data for specific time periods.
- Calculate total revenue and average order value.
- Identify top-selling pizzas and customer preferences.
- Analyze customer retention and churn rates.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for querying and analyzing the database.
- **Database Management System**: MySQL .

## Project Structure
- **queries.sql**: Contains SQL queries used for analysis.
- **data_model.png**: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the database schema.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis:
1. **Set up Database**: Create the necessary tables and import the dataset into your DBMS.
2. **Run Queries**: Execute the queries in `queries.sql` to perform the analysis.
3. **Interpret Results**: Review the query results and visualize findings if necessary.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the pizza sales data using SQL, valuable insights can be gained to improve business operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.
